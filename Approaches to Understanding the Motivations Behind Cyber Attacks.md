Two types of correlation analysis 

1. variable correlation 
2. network analysis - Quadratic assignment procedure (QAP)对两个房方阵的近似性进行比较，给出相关性系数，以对矩阵的置换为基础。

### Analysis Tools
1. Network visualization - generated using ORA software

### Dataset

+ www.digitalattackmap.com. The dataset starts from May 2013 and is updated daily, and shares top 2% of global ddos-attacks registered by Arbor Networks.
